Assignment 3.2

Ques1. Obtain the elements of the union between two character vectors.
       vec1=c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,]))
       vec2=c(rownames(mtcars[10:32,]))
     vec1                             # this will display the 1to 15 elements.
     vec2                             # this will display the 10 to 32 elements.
     newvec<-union(vec1,vec2)         # will use the union function on vec1 and vec2 and will store result in vec, this will give the elements of vec1 and vec2 without repeating them.
     newvec

Ques 2. Get those elements that are common to both vectors.
        vec1=c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,]))
        vec2=c(rownames(mtcars[10:32,]))
   cvector<-vec1%in%vec2         # will give the common elements of vec1 and vec2

Ques 3. Get the difference of the elements between two character vectors.
        vec1=c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,]))
        vec2=c(rownames(mtcars[10:32,]))
        vec1[!vec1%in%vec2]                                   #this will display the elements of vec1 which are not present in vec2
        vec2[!vec2%in%vec1]                                   #this will display the elements of vec2 which are not present in vec1
union(vec1[!vec1%in%vec2],vec2[!vec2%in%vec1])                #this will display those elements that are not common in vec1 and vec2


Ques 4. Test the quality of the two character vectors.
        vec1=c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,]))
        vec2=c(rownames(mtcars[11:25,]))
        vec1 %in% vec2
        identical(vec1,vec2)    # whether vec1 and vec2 are identical
